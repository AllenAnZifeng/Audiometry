The goal is to implement and evaluate a smartphone based audiometry hearing test app. The tasks include:

1. Investigate how and what types of audiometry hearing tests are currently done in audio labs
2. A comparison of the features and usability of representative audiometry hearing tests on iOS and android devices
3. Implementation of an audiometry hearing test app. 
4. Apply for McMaster research ethic approval and conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of the app among people with different degrees of hearing losses and compare the results with standard audio lab tests.
